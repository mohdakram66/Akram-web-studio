    <div class="card">
        <p>In today’s digital world, having a professional website is no longer optional — it’s a necessity. Whether you run a small shop, service business, or personal brand, a website helps you build trust and reach more customers.</p>
        <p>A professional website works as your online office that is open 24/7. People can learn about your services, see your work, and contact you anytime without calling you.</p>

        <p><strong>Benefits of a Professional Website:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Builds trust and credibility</li>
            <li>Helps you reach new customers</li>
            <li>Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop</li>
            <li>Shows your services clearly</li>
            <li>Improves online presence</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many people judge a business by its website design. A clean, fast, and mobile-friendly website makes a strong first impression.</p>
        <p>If your business is not online, you are losing potential customers every day. A professional website helps you grow faster and stand out from competitors.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always choose a responsive and SEO-friendly design.</p>
